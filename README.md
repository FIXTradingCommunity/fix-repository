# fix-repository
This project contains the XML schema (XSD) for FIX Repository, the metadata model for FIX specifications.

## Uses
Repository is used to generate
* FIXimate3.0
* FIXML Schema
* Microsoft Word Specification documents

## Version
The latest version of XML schema is called **2010 Edition**. The version of the schema is different than the versions of FIX specifications that it is used to create. Specifications are issued as major FIX versions plus Extension Packs.

## Formats
Each repository version is produced in multiple formats:
* Basic repository: A set of xml files that provides a machine readable representation of each version of a FIX specification.
* Intermediate repository: a basic repository is combined into a single XML file.
* Unified repository: a single XML file is produced for the machine readable portion of one or more basic repositories, e.g. FIX 5.0 plus FIXT 1.1. Machine readable and humanly readable documentation are separated, however.
